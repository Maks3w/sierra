# Dependabot Update Policy
# =========================
#
# This configuration manages automated dependency updates across the project.
#
# Update Schedule:
# - All ecosystems run weekly on Mondays at 09:00 Europe/London
# - Cooldown periods help ensure stability:
#   * Standard updates: 7-day cooldown after release in case the new release
#     contains some critical bug
#   * Major version updates: 14-day cooldown after release so proper migration
#     issues and steps are known. We want to avoid to be the first on discovering
#     how to migrate to the new major version.
#
# Package Ecosystem Notes:
# - Using "bun" ecosystem for JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies
# - Note: Dependabot does not yet support automatic security updates for the "bun"
#   package ecosystem. Security vulnerabilities will not trigger automatic PRs.
#   Manual monitoring of security advisories is required.
